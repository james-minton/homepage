         Hi, I'm James Minton. I'm a New Yorker (by way of Louisiana) who runs a design, web development, and data visualization company called <a href="https://hyperobjekt.com" target="_blank">Hyperobjekt</a>. My cross-disciplinary background includes degrees in photography, multimedia arts, and psychology, plus work on documentaries. I use this space for sharing life & work updates, photography, links, and (possibly, one of these days) film & art commentary.
