After more than a year of hard work, with hundreds of pages built and contributors filling several floors of Midtown office space, the new and greatly improved NYU School of Medicine website has launched. My role has encompassed a hodgepodge of graphic design, style guide development, photo editing, and the establishment of site-wide “motifs” for photographic treatments. Additionally, a number of my photographs (both commissioned and from my personal archive) are featured throughout its pages.

The result is a very attractive-looking, informative, and modern site that’s worthy of such a prestigious institution. <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">Give it a look!</a>
