In the daunting task of building a nationwide eviction mapping tool, the <a href="https://www.evictionlab.org/" target="_blank">evictionab.org</a> web team and I were greatly aided by our partnership with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">Mapbox</a> (the company and the platform). Knowing both the power of their tools and their commitment to public service projects, we reached out and found them very responsive and willing to help us meet our needs.

They also honored us with <a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/eviction-lab-map-617edfced73b" target="_blank">an interview</a>, where we took a deep dive into our design and technical processes, and offered a preview of things to come. If youâ€™re curious about how our site and tools were built, give it a read!
