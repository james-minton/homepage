<a href="https://www.colage.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COLAGE</a> is an organization that supports children of LGBTQ parents via nationwide chapters and meetups, along with self-produced guides, videos, and other resources. Working with designer <a href="http://www.rafaelsoldi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rafael Soldi</a>, I developed a site that features a custom events display, an interactive map of local resources, and more. Coming soon: an e-commerce page for COLAGE-branded clothing and swag, and a membership-based, COLAGEr-only space for trainings and other materials.
