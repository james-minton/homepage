<p>It's my honor to serve with Princeton University's Eviction Lab (led by sociologist and author of <em>Evicted</em>, Matthew Desmond) as Creative Director for the recently-launched <a href="https://evictionlab.org" target="_blank">evictionlab.org</a>. A year ago, Desmond approached me with a project of daunting scale: he and his Lab had compiled over 83 million court records to create the first-ever nationwide database of eviction statistics, and he had a website in mind that would offer the following features: <span id="more-3104"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://evictionlab.org/map" target="_blank">map tool</a> that plots eviction rates from the state level down to Census block groups, and everything in between</li>
<li>The ability to layer on other census variables as well, to explore possible correlations</li>
<li>Graphing tools to compare locations and their eviction trends over time</li>
<li>The ability to generate PDF, Powerpoint, and Excel spreadsheet reports for user-selected locations</li>
<li>An <a href="https://evictionlab.org/rankings" target="_blank">eviction rankings tool</a> to reveal America's top evicting locations</li>
<li>Blog posts and other static web pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short, I put together and led a team of designers and developers to realize this vision, and the result can be seen at <a href="https://evictionlab.org">evictionlab.org</a>. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/upshot&#038;action=click&#038;contentCollection=upshot&#038;region=rank&#038;module=package&#038;version=highlights&#038;contentPlacement=1&#038;pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">front page New York Times article</a> announced the project to the world, and an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/12/601783346/first-ever-evictions-database-shows-were-in-the-middle-of-a-housing-crisis" target="_blank">NPR Fresh Air interview with Desmond</a> followed soon after. My team and I were also <a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/eviction-lab-map-617edfced73b" target="_blank">interviewed by our mapping technology partner</a>, Mapbox, and I served as a panelist at <a href="https://locate.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">their Locate! conference</a>. Since then, we&#8217;ve seen nearly 150 articles mentioning the dataset in local and national outlets, and cities around the country have taken note and begun to reckon with their eviction crises. </p>
<p>I'm glad to see this website helping to bring America's invisible eviction epidemic to light, because losing one's home comes with a host of negative social consequences. As Desmond says, "without stable shelter, everything else falls apart."</p>
