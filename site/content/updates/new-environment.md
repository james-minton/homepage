Hi & welcome to my new website. A revamp has long been overdue, so I decided to build something more minimalist / lightweight: a database-free static site.

<a href="https://eran.sandler.co.il/2017/06/04/goodbye-wordpress-hello-static-netlify/" target="_blank">This article</a> expresses my sentiments pretty well re: the reasons to ditch my old framework (a certain widely used, database-driven CMS) and move to a static site generator. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/06/07/static-sites-vs-cms" target="_blank">Here's another that lays out the advantages and disadvantages of the new approach</a>. I (for one) will not miss all the unnecessary bloat, the high hosting charges, or the need to constantly update dependencies (which, often enough, has the effect of breaking a site). Oh yeah, and I won't miss the constant stream of brute-force hacker attempts emanating (for reasons not entirely clear) from the former Soviet Union.

The technical details: I'm building the site using Hugo, with deployment and hosting via Netlify. I've been enjoying exploring & playing around with various API's, so I made a weather feed using <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a>. 

Other things I'll be getting to soon: a gallery of some of my better photos, a running news page featuring articles I've found interesting, and I'll probably also hook in some other feeds of interest. Stay tuned.
