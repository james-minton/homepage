Hi & welcome to the long-overdue revamp of my website. For this latest iteration, I decided to experiment with something more lightweight and minimalist: a database-free static site.

<a href="https://eran.sandler.co.il/2017/06/04/goodbye-wordpress-hello-static-netlify/" target="_blank">This article</a> expresses my sentiments pretty well re: the reasons to ditch my old framework (a certain widely used, database-driven CMS) and move to a static site generator. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/06/07/static-sites-vs-cms" target="_blank">Here's another that lays out the advantages and disadvantages of the new approach</a>. I for one will not miss all the unnecessary bloat, the hosting charges, or the need to constantly update dependencies (which, often enough, has the effect of breaking a site). Nor will I miss the constant stream of brute-force hacking attempts.

The technical details: I'm building the site using Hugo, with deployment and hosting via Netlify. The weather feed comes via the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> API. 

Other things I'll be getting to soon: a gallery of some of my better photos, a running news page featuring articles that have caught my attention, and I'll probably also hook in some other feeds of interest. Stay tuned.
