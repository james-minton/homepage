Welcome to the long-overdue revamp of my website. For this latest iteration, I'm going with a lighter-weight, database-free framework inspired by the recommendations of my fellow developers on <a href="https://evictionlab.org" target="_blank">evictionlab.org</a>.

<a href="https://eran.sandler.co.il/2017/06/04/goodbye-wordpress-hello-static-netlify/" target="_blank">This article</a> expresses my sentiments pretty well re: the reasons to ditch my old platform (a certain widely used, database-driven CMS) and move to a static site generator. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/06/07/static-sites-vs-cms" target="_blank">Here's another that lays out the advantages and disadvantages of the new approach</a>. I for one will not miss all the unnecessary bloat, the hosting charges, or the need to constantly update dependencies (which, often enough, has the effect of breaking a site). Nor will I miss the constant stream of brute-force hacking attempts.

The technical details: I'm building the site using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>, with deployment and hosting via <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. The weather feed comes via the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> API. 

Other things I'll be getting to soon: a gallery of some of my better photos, a running news page featuring articles that have caught my attention, and I'll probably also hook in some other feeds of interest. Stay tuned.
