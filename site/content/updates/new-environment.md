Hi & welcome to my new website. It's been long past time for a revamp for a while now, but I'v had the good luck of being too busy with other work till now. Over a short summer break, I decided to take what I learned from the process of building <a href="https://evictionlab.org" target="_blank">evictionlab.org</a> and create something more minimalist / lightweight: a database-free static site.

<a href="https://eran.sandler.co.il/2017/06/04/goodbye-wordpress-hello-static-netlify/" target="_blank">This article</a> expresses my sentiments pretty well re: the reasons to ditch my old framework (a certain widely used, database-driven CMS) and move to a static site generator. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/06/07/static-sites-vs-cms" target="_blank">Here's another that lays out the  advantages and disadvantages of the new approach</a>.

The technical details: I'm building the site using Hugo, with deployment and hosting via Netlify. I've been enjoying exploring & playing around with various API's, so I made a weather feed using <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a>, and my "latest tracks" feed is from Spotify via <a href="https://www.last.fm/api/intro" target="_blank">Last.fm's API</a>.
