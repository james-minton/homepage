I'm very excited to announce the launch of <a title="Just Shelter website" href="http://justshelter.org" target="_blank">justshelter.org</a>, which serves as a portal for raising awareness of eviction's role in perpetuating poverty, for sharing eviction stories, and for locating housing resources. Under the auspices of our design company <a href="http://flare-fade.net" target="_blank">Flare/ Fade</a>,  Noele Lusano and I created the site for Harvard sociologist and 2015 MacArthur Fellow <a href="https://www.macfound.org/fellows/933/" target="_blank">Matthew Desmond</a>. The project was conceived as a companion to Desmond's book, the just-released "<a href="http://evictedbook.com/" target="_blank">Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City</a>," which you will likely be hearing about in the coming weeks as Desmond promotes it across the country.

Just Shelter has already received mention in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/books/a-harvard-sociologist-on-watching-families-lose-their-homes.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Great-Expectations-of/235413" target="_blank">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, and several other national media outlets.
